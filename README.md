# Earnings Call Transcript Database And Analysis with Natural Language Toolkit in Python

## The goal/inspiration

In the project, 

### Step 1: Downloading all transcripts from a company's Investor Relations page using Python

Firstly, we have collected the earnings call transcript pdf links on companies' official websites.

Then, we downloaded and saved each file as PDF, and consolidate all PDFs into a .pkl file.

The final data structure looks like this... Each row will have one quarter's earnings call transcript from one company.
